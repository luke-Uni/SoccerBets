# SoccerBets
 
 This project is a betting system developed as a RESTful-Server.
 
- Soccerbets is a betting system where it is possible to bet money on fantasy soccer teams.
- The games/events are simulated by the system.
- The results of the events are not realistic, because it is fantasy soccer.

Updates
- Currently, all data is temporarily stored on the RESTful server. So these will only be usable during runtime.
  This will soon be updated with the implementation of a MongoDB database.
- This RESTful-Server will also get a frontend soon. The frontend is currently being developed with the help of VUEjs.
